So the\ncorresponding changes have to be added. Add verification test for RSA.\n\nChanges\n-------\n    * EncryptedField annotation contains only the provider name.\n    * Instead of encryptionConfig the crypto manager has been added.\n    * JsonObject has separate APIs for encrypt and decrypt fields. This\n      has a slight variation from the RFC as it is easier for using\n      JsonObject. The reason for separate API is that new error classes\n      have been introduced for encryption.\n    * Move APIs from uncommitted to committed\n\nResults\n-------\nVerification tests pass,,,

We must not present the credentials\nfor the original URI in that case. Consider a malicious redirect A->B:\nthis would allow server B to harvest the user credentials for server\nA.

This requires keeping track of the un-chomped command\n  strings from the original protocol stream.\n- Separate the parser from the certificate itself so the actual\n  PushCertificate object can be immutable. Make a fair attempt at deep\n  immutability but this is not possible with the current mutable\n  ReceiveCommand structure.\n- Use more detailed error messages that don't involve NON-NLS strings.\n- Document null return values more thoroughly. Instead of having the\n  undocumented behavior of throwing NPE from certain methods if they\n  are not first guarded by enabled() eliminate enabled() and return\n  null from those methods.\n- Add tests for parsing a push cert from a section of pkt-line stream\n  using a real live stream captured with Wireshark (which it should\n  be noted uncovered several simply incorrect statements in C git's\n  Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt).\n\nThis is a slightly breaking API change to classes that were\ntechnically public and technically released in 4.0.

Such queries are sent to the server by\ntransforming them into Json (the N1QL server accepts Json body in POST\nfor queries).\nThree implementations have been added: SimpleQuery replaces the use of\nQuery in previous versions while ParametrizedQuery and PreparedQuery\nallow to fill values for positional or named parameters in a Statement.\n\nPrevious methods query(String s) on buckets have been removed. Ad hoc\nquerying is still possible by providing a complete json representation\nof the query parameters and all included through the queryRaw method.\n\nThe equivalent of previous query(Query q) method is now query(Statement\ns) as the original Query interface has been renamed to Statement.\n\nGenericQueryRequest has been refactored in core to use factory methods\nto distinguish between a simple statement and a full json query. The\nlatest is now in use in CouchbaseAsyncBucket.\n\nAdded tests for the construction of N1QL json from various Queries.\n\nResult\n------\nUser now construct Statements using the DSL that they use in a Query.\nThese conforms better to the dp4 specification of N1QL querying and\nwill ultimately allow for optional and named parameters to be used.\n\nChange-Id: I148fb2694bffe0e4235f5a151186037e92713656\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/44595\nTested-by: Simon Basl\u00e9 <simon@couchbase.com>\nReviewed-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael.nitschinger@couchbase.com>",,,

Most of them\ntake the ByteBuf and convert it in another format (eg JSON) and don't\naccess the buffer after that which is a good candidate point for the\nrelease of the buffer.\n\nAdditionally even when the transcoder released the buffer on success\nit was not released before throwing a TranscodingException.\n\nWe would gain from a standard \"automatic\" way of releasing the buffer\nin both success or error in decoding. But transcoders that produce an\noutput which still holds the buffer (eg BinaryTranscoder) should not\nrelease it.\n\nModifications\n-------------\nThe AbstractTranscoder now releases the buffer in case of both success\nand error provided the corresponding \"shouldAutoreleaseOnXXX\" methods\nreturn true (which is the default).\n\nBinaryTranscoder has shouldAutoreleaseOnDecode return false whereas it\nhas shouldAutoreleaseOnError return true allowing BinaryDocument to\nkeep hold of the ByteBuf down the line.\n\nCorresponding tests have been put in place. They test both success and\nerror in decode operation. BinaryTest checks that the success case\ndoesn't release the buffer.\n\nOn JsonTranscoder a specific static method converts ByteBuf to Json.\nThis method doesn't release the buffer and has been documented and\ntested to reflect that this is on purpose.\n\nResult\n------\nBy default any implementation of AbstractTranscoder will release its\ncontent buffer after decode operation either successful or in error.\n\nBinaryTranscoder doesn't release buffers on decode success but does on\ndecode error.\n\nAll transcoder tests pass and check the coherence of the buffer refCnt\nreference count after decode operation for the type of transcoder.\n\nNote that something should be done to inform the user that it is his\nresponsibility to manually release the buffer of a BinaryDocument.\n\nChange-Id: I1f62a832fc67eab78b4a12d4f8af371b3c89ab17\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/42417\nTested-by: Simon Basl\u00e9 <simon@couchbase.com>\nReviewed-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael.nitschinger@couchbase.com>",,,

If a value is passed into the\nsubject and the subscription is gone it releases the buffers to avoid\na leak. This works under the assumption that there can only be one subscriber\nand the deffered observable is indeed a subject.\n\nSo far this holds true for all conditions inside our client but to double\ncheck and make errors explicit we have an instanceof check in place which\nwill fail hard if that constraint is violated otherwise the hidden\nside effects would be very hard to debug.\n\nResult\n------\nCode like this does not leak anymore:\n\nbucket.async().get(\"foo\").timeout(1 TimeUnit.MICROSECOND).subscribe();\n\nIt in general provides much better guarantees wich making sure that\nif an early unsubscribe happens the underlying buffers are freed if\nthey are refcounted and their count is > 0 (to avoid double frees).\n\nThe joys of object pooling.\n\nChange-Id: I4889d800e3d1835705c6e94992179db93bfae378\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/70253\nReviewed-by: Subhashni Balakrishnan <b.subhashni@gmail.com>\nTested-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael@nitschinger.at>",,,

These each\nreturn an adequate builder that can be used to describe either the\nlookups or mutations to be performed.\n\nLookupInBuilder uses AsyncLookupInBuilder under the cover and similarly\nMutateInBuilder blocks on AsyncMutateInBuilder.

This also will be needed for\nautomatic retry and prevents a livelock situation in said retry (by\nensuring that the nodes will all converge to a state where the statement\nis prepared and named similarly).\n\nAsyncQueryResult's info is now a stream of QueryMetrics directly in the\nconstructor signature.\n\nAdded a DigestUtils class that can encode a String in SHA1 used as the\nidentifier for a given statement (low chances of collisions between two\nwell-formed N1QL statements).\n\nTests have been added and amended but integration testing is not\nentirely possible while there's no mean of removing a prepared statement\nfrom the server's cache.\n\nModified integration tests ClusterManagerTest (avoid dropping buckets\nthat aren't related to the test) and QueryTest (use scanConsistency and\nwait at beginning of test to avoid a \"index rollback\" due to flush).\n\nResults\n-------\nAll tests pass prepared statements are referenced by name instead of\nsending the whole execution plan over the wire.

This exception\nis then captured by an error handler and a retry (after a 10ms delay) is triggered.\n\nNote that all other exceptions will be allowed to pass through as well as specific error bodies\nwhich have been identified to be \"correct\" responses and need to bubble up to the user - such\nas a missing view.\n\nThe current code will retry until it gets a successful response once a fail fast mode is\nimplemented there can be an option added to cancel it right away.\n\nResult\n------\nMore resilient error handling when transient server response errors are recieved especially\nduring rebalance and failover.

Right now they\nneed to put in their module-info.java:\n\nmodule com.mycompany {\n    requires java.client;\n}\n\nthis will change it to:\n\nmodule com.mycompany {\n    requires com.couchbase.java.client;\n}\n\nNote that this does not make us a 'proper' Java 9 module e.g. one with\na module-info.java and compiled with JDK9.  We cannot do that right\nnow as we need to be JDK6.  But Java 9 has a feature called\n'automatic modules' where a Java 9 app can add our jar to the\n--module-path and it will pretend we're a proper module.  This change\nensures we have a better module name than the auto-guessed 'java.client'.\n\nModifications\n-------------\nAdding Automatic-Module-Name into the jar's manifest file.\n\nNote this isn't really a breaking change even though we're changing the\nmodule name as currently you can't use our jar as an automatic module\nanyway (see JCBC-1193).\n\nThere's an unrelated removal of the Sonotype plugin which causes Maven\nto fail on my system.  I believe it's not needed - please verify.\n\nNo way to unit test but I've tested manually against JDK6 and 9 apps.\n\nResult\n------\nWorks as currently from a JDK6 app.\n\nIn a JDK9 app the new module name works.\n\nChange-Id: I120556f1c0e180d3cd4297c68780e2230edfc8a2\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/93419\nTested-by: Build Bot <build@couchbase.com>\nReviewed-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael@nitschinger.at>\nReviewed-by: David Nault <david.nault@couchbase.com>",,,

In the 2.x SDK one can easily simulate that with\nflatMap and bulk operations but it makes it necessary to fall back to\nasync operations.\n\nIf someone is using the sync API we need to make sure to get the best\nperformance.

In addition\nthe logic checks if it is enabled and if so it flatMaps the documents through\nimplict get() calls in the async flow leading to very efficient bulk calls\neven on the blocking API.\n\nThe actual API does not change on the rows because internally it lazily\nevaluates if the document is already set or not which means that the\nold behaviour is still there too.\n\nResult\n------\nVery efficient document loading even on the blocking API.

The contexts in\nwhich Authenticator can provide credential are enumerated in the\nCredentialContext enum.\n\nThe Authenticator is set on the Cluster only. Buckets (and N1QL/FTS\nqueries initiated from Buckets) still have a strong dependency to a\nsingle password through the SASL dance and the way connections are\nestablished. However it is possible to manually set credentials for\nmultiple buckets on a N1qlQuery.\n\nGenerally the authenticator should be prepared and set before opening\nbuckets once. However it can be changed later on via  the\n`Cluster#authenticate` method. If a reference is kept to it it can\nalso be mutated.\n\nThe following Cluster methods make use of the Authenticator when no\nexplicit credential is provided: clusterManager() and\nopenBucket(String bucketName). The later will also default to an empty\npassword if no credentials can be found in the Authenticator.\n\nResults:\n--------\nImplicit credentials can be retrieved from a configurable Authenticator\nwhich paves the way for further authentication modes support and cluster\nlevel authentication.\n\nJoins on protected buckets now work provided their credentials have\nbeen set on the N1qlParams object.\n\nChange-Id: Ia58107462cbeb8b3b2b86402a8e5e11c2ee92c3e\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/66801\nReviewed-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael@nitschinger.at>\nTested-by: Simon Basl\u00e9 <simon@couchbase.com>",,,
