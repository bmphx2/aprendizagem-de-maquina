So the\ncorresponding changes have to be added. Add verification test for RSA.\n\nChanges\n-------\n    * EncryptedField annotation contains only the provider name.\n    * Instead of encryptionConfig the crypto manager has been added.\n    * JsonObject has separate APIs for encrypt and decrypt fields. This\n      has a slight variation from the RFC as it is easier for using\n      JsonObject. The reason for separate API is that new error classes\n      have been introduced for encryption.\n    * Move APIs from uncommitted to committed\n\nResults\n-------\nVerification tests pass\n\nChange-Id: I572c8a92acee8a1503c7466063010344c174f64d\nReviewed-on: http://review.couchbase.org/95855\nReviewed-by: Michael Nitschinger <michael@nitschinger.at>\nTested-by: Subhashni Balakrishnan <b.subhashni@gmail.com>,,,

Upstream\ninterfaces also evolve quite erratically and evolution doesn't seem\nto follow semantic versioning.\n\nIntroduce a new KeyPasswordProvider interface so that we don't have\nto depend on the upstream FilePasswordProvider in our API.

        security,Do authentication re-tries on HTTP POST\n\nThere is at least one git server out there (GOGS) that does\nnot require authentication on the initial GET for\ninfo/refs?service=git-receive-pack but that _does_ require\nauthentication for the subsequent POST to actually do the push.\n\nThis occurs on GOGS with public repositories; for private\nrepositories it wants authentication up front.\n\nHandle this behavior by adding 401 handling to our POST request.\nNote that this is suboptimal; we'll re-send the push data at\nleast twice if an authentication failure on POST occurs. It\nwould be much better if the server required authentication\nup-front in the GET request.\n\nAdded authentication unit tests (using BASIC auth) to the\nSmartClientSmartServerTest:\n\n- clone with authentication\n- clone with authentication but lacking CredentialsProvider\n- clone with authentication and wrong password\n- clone with authentication after redirect\n- clone with authentication only on POST but not on GET\n\nAlso tested manually in the wild using repositories at try.gogs.io.\nThat server offers only BASIC auth so the other paths\n(DIGEST NEGOTIATE fall back from DIGEST to BASIC) are untested\nand I have no way to test them.\n\n* public repository: GET unauthenticated POST authenticated\n  Also tested after clearing the credentials and then entering a\n  wrong password: correctly asks three times during the HTTP\n  POST for user name and password then gives up.\n* private repository: authentication already on GET; then gets\n  applied correctly initially to the POST request which succeeds.\n\nAlso fix the authentication to use the credentials for the redirected\nURI if redirects had occurred. We must not present the credentials\nfor the original URI in that case. Consider a malicious redirect A->B:\nthis would allow server B to harvest the user credentials for server\nA. The unit test for authentication after a redirect also tests for\nthis.\n\nBug: 513043\nChange-Id: I97ee5058569efa1545a6c6f6edfd2b357c40592a\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Wolf <thomas.wolf@paranor.ch>\nSigned-off-by: Matthias Sohn <matthias.sohn@sap.com>,,,

This requires keeping track of the un-chomped command\n  strings from the original protocol stream.\n- Separate the parser from the certificate itself so the actual\n  PushCertificate object can be immutable. Make a fair attempt at deep\n  immutability but this is not possible with the current mutable\n  ReceiveCommand structure.\n- Use more detailed error messages that don't involve NON-NLS strings.\n- Document null return values more thoroughly. Instead of having the\n  undocumented behavior of throwing NPE from certain methods if they\n  are not first guarded by enabled() eliminate enabled() and return\n  null from those methods.\n- Add tests for parsing a push cert from a section of pkt-line stream\n  using a real live stream captured with Wireshark (which it should\n  be noted uncovered several simply incorrect statements in C git's\n  Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt).\n\nThis is a slightly breaking API change to classes that were\ntechnically public and technically released in 4.0. However it is\nhighly unlikely that people were actually depending on public\nbehavior since there were no public methods to create\nPushCertificates with anything other than null field values or a\nPushCertificateParser that did anything other than infinite loop or\nthrow exceptions when reading.\n\nChange-Id: I5382193347a8eb1811032d9b32af9651871372d0,,,

Also use TreeMaps with a case-insensitive\nkey comparator instead of converting keys to uppercase. Add a test\nto verify that keys are matched case-insensitively.\n\nMost of the parsing code was simply moved except that the new\nparser supports looking up entries given host name port and user\nname and can thus handle more %-substitutions correctly. This\nfeature is not yet used and cannot be used with JSch since JSch\nonly has a ConfigRepository.getConfig(String) interface.\n\nThe split is still worth the trouble as it opens the way to using\nanother ssh client altogether. Apache MINA sshd for instance\nresolves host entries giving host name port and user name.\n\n(Apache MINA has a built-in ssh config handling but that has\nproblems too: its pattern matching is case-insensitive and its\nmerging of host entries if several match is not the same as in\nOpenSsh. But with this refactoring it will be possible to plug in\nOpenSshConfigFile into an Apache MINA sshd  client without dragging\nalong JSch.)\n\nOne test case that doesn't make sense anymore has been removed. It\ntested that repeatedly querying for a host entry returned the same\nobject.

        security,Delegate crypto algorithm creation to InsecureCipherFactory\n\nThis is a preparation change to Bazel build implementation. Error\nProne rejects the code with variable crypto algorithm as insecure\nsee: [1].\n\n[1] http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/InsecureCryptoUsage\n\nChange-Id: I92db70a7da454bc364597a995e8be5dccc2d6427\nSigned-off-by: David Ostrovsky <david@ostrovsky.org>,,,
        security,Mark fields of BaseReceivePack private\n\nNone of these should have been exposed to base classes. The majority\nof them are private implementation details that are not required by a\nsubclass in order to interact with the base protocol definition. The\nfew that are needed should be visible as accessor methods so the\ninternals can be modified without breaking the public JGit API.\n\nChange-Id: I874179105c9c37703307facbbf99387c52bf772c\nSigned-off-by: Matthias Sohn <matthias.sohn@sap.com>,,,
        security,Support http.<url>.* configs\n\nGit has a rather elaborate mechanism to specify HTTP configuration\noptions per URL based on pattern matching the URL against \"http\"\nsubsection names.[1] The URLs used for this matching are always the\noriginal URLs; redirected URLs do not participate.\n\n* Scheme and host must match exactly case-insensitively.\n* An optional user name must match exactly.\n* Ports must match exactly after default ports have been filled in.\n* The path of a subsection if any must match a segment prefix of\n  the path of the URL.\n* Matches with user name take precedence over equal-length path\n  matches without but longer path matches are preferred over\n  shorter matches with user name.\n\nImplement this for JGit. Factor out the HttpConfig from TransportHttp\nand implement the matching and override mechanism.\n\nThe set of supported settings is still the same; JGit currently\nsupports only followRedirects postBuffer and sslVerify plus the\nJGit-specific maxRedirects key.\n\nAdd tests for path normalization and prefix matching only on segment\nseparators and use the new mechanism in SmartClientSmartServerSslTest\nto disable sslVerify selectively for only the test server URLs.\n\nCompare also bug 374703 and bug 465492. With this commit it would be\npossible to set sslVerify to false for only the git server using a\nself-signed certificate instead of having to switch it off globally\nvia http.sslVerify.\n\n[1] https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config\n\nChange-Id: I42a3c2399cb937cd7884116a2a32fcaa7a418fcb\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Wolf <thomas.wolf@paranor.ch>,,,
